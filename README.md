# android_gstreamer

This branch contains the GStreamer tutorials for Android.
They didn't build correctly out of the box under Android Studio Dolphin.
I applied the necessary fixes I found from googling.
I tried to minimize the changes I had to make and things are a bit hacky, but the tutorials build and run properly.
Hope this helps others who run into similar issues.
